Steam-Linux Flash fixer
=================
Wrote this purely out of boredom. It downloads the latest flash version and moves it to the appropriate directory so Steam can utilise it. It won't overwrite any files, so don't be scared.

Simply copy the text and make a new file called flash_steam.sh
Then type in console:
chmod +x flash_steam.sh
./flash_steam.sh
